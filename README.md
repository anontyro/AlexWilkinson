My Homepage

#### Development - Active
I wrote my current homepage (alexwilkinson.co) in Django and it was created very much in the early days of my programming journey.
Although it taught me a lot I feel it has awful design and is generally a bit of a mess. I heard that ASP finally went crossplatform
and being something I have wanted to play around with for awhile, but not pay for a Microsoft Server this seemed like a an optimum time
for me to dive in to the new framework, as I needed a new webpage anyway.

Although I have found working in a brand new framework quite daunting at times it has also been very rewarding and I can see how far my
knowledge and understand has come so far by comparison to my Django page.

I am greatly enjoying working with C# which feels like a hyped up version of Java with a few interesting new ideas. Along with Visual
Studio and the Asp.net core framework the project has been very interesting and I have quickly fallen for the Microsoft technologies.

Project Breakdown
---
1. Project written in C#.
2. Framework is ASP.NET Core.
3. I expect to use a MYSQL database although still considering options.
4. I am using Microsofts build in ASP authentication, still learning how to use correctly.
5. I am developing in Visual Studio 2017.
6. Views written using the Microsoft Razor templaying engine.

### The Code
The site will contain a landing page which is fairly basic full screen image using a bootstrap menubar at the top. The blog has proven to
be one of the more complex tasks, although .Net Core comes with scaffolding to create the basic CRUD operations quickly from a model you set.
This has really sped up the process greatly and allowed me to skip over the basics and spend more time on producing them to be the way I
need myself. 

I have taken the pagination library from NuGet and implemented it myself with myown logic as a lot of the code seemed not to work correctly.
I am still working through the Blog section trying to implement it the way I want before moving onto my Portfolio section.

I expect to implement a reasonably basic portfolio section to start with but I am on making it more dynamic with Angular2 in time.

I aim my Resume page to be an interactive resume which is hopefully presented in a visually appealing way.


## UX
I have been taking the design very seriously and started to style as I go along trying to make the pages memorable whilst adhering to
common conventions. A lot of my base design has already been implemented and I am aiming for a minimalistic style with strong contrasting
colours to produce pages that are highly memorable.
