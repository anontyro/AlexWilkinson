            <span class="highligher">Me</span> I seriously got into the idea of programming in
            2015 self teaching myself Java initally. I decided to later formalise my learning by
            completing a post-grad course from Manchester University (UK) Introduction to software
            Development in <span class="highligher">Java</span>. 
            From here I have expanded my knowledge to Python, 
            <span class="highligher">C#</span> Javascript
            along with 
            <span class="highligher">Android</span>, Django, Asp.Net Core and 
            <span class="highligher">SQL</span> databases.

            development ever since I was in High school, however I only recently got serious
            about it. This is the second iteration of my homepage, now written in 
            <span class="highligher">Asp.Net Core</span> as the Framework using C# on a Ubuntu
            server with <span class="highligher">JQuery</span> and
